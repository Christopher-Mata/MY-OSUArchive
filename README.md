## MY OSU Background
I was a former OSU Top Player peaking at rank 990 in 2016 but slowly reached my current rank of 109,000 due to an RSI injury and inability to compete with the skill of the newer OSU generation.
As I am now washed, I made this repo to easily recover my OSU environment when I switch and factory reset my computers, instead of focusing on being craked in OSU again, I have made it just a hobby with my main focus going into Software Engineering and Fixing my broken car engines :(
